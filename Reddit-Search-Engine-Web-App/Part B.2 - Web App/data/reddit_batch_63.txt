The latest reform focuses on allowing the department to pay decent and respectable salaries to their officers. They say that getting rid of huge Microsoft's licensing prices will contribute greatly to that cause.

Lets break this down.\n\n>Backup\n\nrsync (which has been ported to windows via DeltaCopy due to how well it works.) is widely considered one of the best backup tools made.\n\n>Firefox\n\nBeen running Vivaldi lately. Pretty fun, but chromium is definitely my main browser. Where are the issues you were talking about? I load every page I can think of going with absolutely zero issues. Hundreds of in house applications at work. All my extensions, 20+, work (although there's a few issues between a couple of them, those issues are present in chrome on windows 7/8.1/10 as well.) There is zero reasons a browser page should be platform dependent, and suggesting otherwise is ridiculous. Building platform specific web pages is completely nonsensical when JavaScript has turned into such a great tool for browsers.\n\n>gimp\n\nGimp is great if you take the time to learn it, or you can use some of the many changes made by Photoshop users to make it feel more at home.\n\nPersonally I use Krita, but I don't edit images often.\n\n>patching\n\nNot sure what could possibly be the issue here if you have your sysadmin environment setup correctly.\n\nCurrently if I had a patch to push, all I would need to do is build the patch, match the clusters/nodes I want to push too and push it... \n\n>Malware\n\nOK...? What? \n\n>Authentication\n\nWindows until recently couldn't even properly SSH, and you are complaining about Linux authentication? Windows as an operating system and server can not even come close to the versatility and options of authentication that Linux has. In the end though, authentication if setup properly doesn't matter what OS you are running...\n\n>Printing\n\nI'll give you this one, just because I don't know how far printing has come in the last little while. I have heard some fantastic things lately about CUPS/Samba printer sharing though. It's not the ability to do something for this, it's just there is actually a learning curve to it and we can all agree that it shouldn't be such a pain.\n\n*I am going off some of your other posts now*\n\n>PDF's\nNot sure the issue here, I work with them quite often in windows and Linux. Going between the two quite often with zero issues.\n\n>Vastly cheaper to get SaaS[...]\n\nQuite the unsubstantiated claim. This absolutely depends on your employee skill sets and experience.\n\n>etc etc.\n\nWhat else? Really, I can go back and forth on this all day if you will actually give me proper logic and reasoning. Unfortunately, nothing you have said so far has any substance.\n\nYou prefer windows over linux, that's fine and dandy. Honestly no one here gives a fuck except for a few hardcore individuals. Linux is about freedom of choice, and you made a choice. But spouting misinformation and blatant lies while personally attacking other people here is pathetic.\n\nAlso your comment about 300 connections being a bad day? 2200 customers?

LineageOS and Android modding is dying. We all hate Big Tech monopolies, Google isn't the cool company it once was, Google is showing their true colors. Yet we let them rule our phones and didn't fight back. We *need* a real GNU/Linux smartphone ecosystem.\n\nWhy hasn't the PC ecosystem locked out Linux? Because Linux is too powerful that nobody can really fight it. We fought against Microsoft's monopoly and even if we don't have the Year of the Desktop Linux, we still have access. But why can [phone OEMs take back bootloader unlocking](https://github.com/melontini/bootloader-unlock-wall-of-shame)? Because LineageOS isn't powerful enough. OEMs, developers and carriers give the middle finger and got us locked out.\n\nLineageOS has a big flaw: it's dependent on Google. Verizon and banks are much more powerful than modders, so much that if they hate Android modding they both can force us to use stock firmware. Whereas Verizon and banks won't block you from using desktop Linux. It's also the fault of the modding community for not fighting back hard enough the way the GNU/Linux community fought the Microsoft monoculture.\n\nFor instance, Chase claims to \"require\" Windows or Mac but doesn't block Linux. Why? Because Linux is too powerful for Chase. Whereas Chase has blocked modded Android for years if you aren't into a cocktail of Magisk modules. One day, that won't work. I've given up on custom ROMs because of a declining ROM ecosystem, and even I'm not too happy about giving OEMs control over my phone.\n\nWhile a GNU/Linux smartphone will lack apps, if the US wins their lawsuit against Apple we could push for Progressive Web Apps to make most mobile apps OS-agnostic and leave native apps for games. Heck, Waydroid would be *perfect* for a GNU/Linux phone: get the Android apps you need in a container.\n\nWhy can desktop Linux and Chromebooks not be niche platforms a la BeOS or AmigaOS? Because many desktop use cases went web so they're truly OS agnostic, aside from rouge developers. And even a user agent switcher can work in most cases. Yes, there's still Word and Photoshop and Autodesk, but enough people don't need them also.", "comments": [{"id": "lqjvufk", "author": "QuantumG", "body": "It's hard to find open source software engineers to build an entirely new ecosystem for free nowadays.", "subreddit": "linux", "parent_id": "t3_1fx5fq0", "permalink": "/r/linux/comments/1fx5fq0/we_need_a_real_gnulinux_not_android_smartphone/lqjvufk/", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1728178602.0, "score": 698, "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "edited": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "lqk3bc3", "author": "dinosaursdied", "body": "Arm controls smart devices.

AOSP now has verified-hardware backed attestation which can be used as a more secure and FOSS alternative that's built-in to Android. But again, there's nothing enforcing that, and awareness does help here since this \\*would\\* support un-rooted custom Android roms.\n\n* Also when you mention apps like Chase, I personally bank with them and they've worked just fine with I ran GrapheneOS (with and without Sandboxed Play Services installed), and CalyxOS.

LineageOS and Android modding is dying.\n\nIt is dying mostly because of Google's \"security\" (mis)features (\"Play Integrity\") that make it a pain to run anything other than an unmodified, unrooted vendor ROM.\n\n>We all hate Big Tech monopolies, Google isn't the cool company it once was, Google is showing their true colors. Yet we let them rule our phones and didn't fight back.\n\nSome developers are trying to fight back with various workarounds fooling \"Play Integrity\". But those are inconvenient to set up, and most users do not want any inconvenience, they just want something that just works.\n\nIn addition, Google is now increasingly relying on hardware-level security (cryptographic \"remote attestation\" between the hardware on the phone and a Google server) that is a lot harder to defeat (and might not be doable at all if the hardware is \"secure\" enough) than the software fallback that the workarounds still rely on (by spoofing old devices that do not support hardware-level security to the Google server). It is likely that hardware-level security will become mandatory to pass \"Play Integrity\" at some point (which will also lock out a lot of unmodified devices from banking and the like, forcing everyone to buy a new device).\n\n>We need a real GNU/Linux smartphone ecosystem.\n\nIt already exists. See dedicated devices such as the [PINE64 PinePhone](https://pine64.org/documentation/PinePhone/), the [PINE64 PinePhone Pro](https://pine64.org/documentation/PinePhone_Pro/), the [Purism Librem 5](https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/), or the [Purism Liberty Phone](https://puri.sm/products/liberty-phone/) (in increasing price order). See also distributions such as [postmarketOS](https://postmarketos.org/) trying to target a lot of devices.\n\nThe thing is, few people use those. (I do, I use a PinePhone as my only smartphone and my primary phone.) There are several reasons:\n\n* application compatibility/availability. While there is an increasing number of [applications released for mobile GNU/Linux](https://linuxphoneapps.org/), it is nowhere near the variety available for Android. Popular Android apps are not likely to ever get ported to GNU/Linux, especially proprietary ones. But even some FOSS ones are only available for Android and iOS, e.g., OsmAnd, or the mobile version of Organic Maps. (Theoretically, you can sorta run Organic Maps on the PinePhone, but it is the desktop version that does not work all that well on mobile.) Desktop GNU/Linux applications are often not usable either, due to not fitting on the screen (especially with the 2\u00d7 zoom that is used by default to make touch misclicks less likely).\n* hardware limitations. The SoCs used in all the PINE64 and Purism phones are old and not optimized for phones. SoCs optimized for phones have poor to no support from mainline Linux kernels, so both vendors had to pick ones with decent support, but not optimized for phones, instead. As a result, the phones are slow and power-hungry. The PinePhone also has very low-resolution cameras.\n* software limitations. Even though it has improved over time, as far as I know, all the available mobile UIs still suffer from bugs and instability to some extent. (At least, Plasma Mobile still crashes on me occasionally. Though what I run is not the latest, but a Plasma 5 version, because unfortunately Manjaro ARM stable has been stalled for more than 6 months now.) And the platform has some limitations by design, in particular, GNU/Linux does not have the kind of power management optimizations Android has (where apps can get unloaded at any time and reloaded from a saved state later and that is completely transparent to the user \u2013 GNU/Linux has nothing like that), which together with the relatively power-hungry SoC leads to a lot shorter battery autonomy than on Android phones.\n\nI have accepted these limitations because it is worth those to me to use a phone that really belongs to me rather than the opposite. But the vast majority of end users are not willing to put up with this kind of limitations. Sadly, even several GNU/Linux enthousiasts have given up on daily-driving the PinePhone, some have even completely given up on the PinePhone, selling it or relegating it to some drawer.", "subreddit": "linux", "parent_id": "t3_1fx5fq0", "permalink": "/r/linux/comments/1fx5fq0/we_need_a_real_gnulinux_not_android_smartphone/lqvyi0y/", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1728358187.0, "score": 1, "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "edited": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "lr0rq76", "author": "Unknown", "body": "Yes!", "subreddit": "linux", "parent_id": "t3_1fx5fq0", "permalink": "/r/linux/comments/1fx5fq0/we_need_a_real_gnulinux_not_android_smartphone/lr0rq76/", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1728432639.0, "score": 1, "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "edited": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "lr1nr7g", "author": "FenderMoon", "body": "Honestly, this might be a lot more feasible if we had two things: \n\n1) better hardware that was reasonably affordable and well supported.

It ships with Android and with a locked bootloader by default. You have to explicitly request a bootloader unlock through their website if you want it. And FairPhone **does not choose** their phones' hardware for FOSS support. (In particular, the bootloader can be unlocked, but **not** replaced. The Qualcomm SoC they use requires the bootloader to be signed by a key burned into the SoC chip, so alternative bootloaders can only be chainloaded, same as on most other Android phones from any random proprietary vendor.)\n\nThere is a community working on mainline support for FairPhone models, just like for other popular Android phones (such as the OnePlus 6). And they got **much** of the hardware working on the FairPhone 4 and 5, but **not all**. In particular, just as for the OnePlus 6, the **cameras** are **not working** yet and **phone call** support is listed as \"**partial**\". See [https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Fairphone\\_4\\_(fairphone-fp4)](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Fairphone_4_(fairphone-fp4)) for the FairPhone 4 and [https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Fairphone\\_5\\_(fairphone-fp5)](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Fairphone_5_(fairphone-fp5)) for the FairPhone 5. FairPhone (the company) does not officially support mainline GNU/Linux. They claim they want to support it, but they do not pick their hardware with that in mind.\n\nSee [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uc2\\_cQmv0TA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uc2_cQmv0TA) for one of their engineers, Luca Weiss, who happens to also be a postmarketOS developer, talking about this very issue. He first spends a lot of time explaining why mainline Linux kernel support is wanted (both by the community and by the company FairPhone), and even phantasizes about switching official software updates for legacy models to mainline kernels (presumably Android on mainline kernel, like GloDroid for the PinePhone), but then when it comes to whether mainline actually works on the FairPhone phones, the talk drifts into excuses upon excuses, with bold statements such as \"cameras will **never** work in mainline\". He even complains that users expect phone calls to work as the minimum baseline functionality, because they are \"hard\" to support.

Neither do they select hardware that already works with mainline kernels, nor do they pay developers to develop, e.g., camera drivers.\n\nThe focus of the FairPhone is to be a fair phone, **not** an open phone, i.e., it is about sustainable and ethically sourced components and about repairability (to save resources and reduce waste, with the benefit this brings to end users as a side effect), **not** about being unlocked and friendly to Free Software (the way PINE64 and Purism phones are).

Because Linux is too powerful that nobody can really fight it.\n\nRather because the PC ecosystem has never been as locked down as the smartphone ecosystem. Though \"features\" such as \"Secure Boot\" also make it increasingly painful. Did you know that all the major distributions have to get their bootloader (usually `shim`, a shim loader that then chainloads the actual bootloader, after signature-checking it against a key embedded in the distribution's build of `shim`) signed by Microsoft so that their distribution can boot without having to disable \"Secure Boot\"? And that smaller distributions usually will not boot under \"Secure Boot\" at all, due to not having that signature? And \"remote attestation\" as used by Android is also slowly coming to PCs, the required hardware support has been shipped on PCs for years. So things are unfortunately moving the opposite direction than you and I would like them to.\n\n>While a GNU/Linux smartphone will lack apps, if the US wins their lawsuit against Apple we could push for Progressive Web Apps to make most mobile apps OS-agnostic and leave native apps for games.  \n\\[\u2026\\]  \nWhy can desktop Linux and Chromebooks not be niche platforms a la BeOS or AmigaOS? Because many desktop use cases went web so they're truly OS agnostic, aside from rouge developers.\n\nI see this push for web stuff as a two-edged sword: Sure, web apps are usually cross-platform, so they can be a way out of OS lock-in. But if you are moving to web stuff for things that can be done by local applications, you are giving up a lot of your freedom. I see people boasting that they use only Free Software, but then looking closer, all the FOSS they really use is the Linux kernel and Firefox or Chromium (or in some cases even the Chrome binary build that is not even FOSS as claimed). Everything else is proprietary web apps inside Firefox, e.g., GMail instead of a local mail client, Google Docs instead of LibreOffice, etc. Are those users really using Free Software then? The use of a remote web service actually makes them **more** dependent on a proprietary software provider than a traditional proprietary application, because the web service can be turned off, feature-restricted, or prohibitively priced at any time. It can also at any time force you to upgrade your browser, or drop support for it entirely if it is a niche browser. Since the application runs on someone else's computer, you cannot even keep or downgrade to an old version, you have to accept any change they force on you.\n\n>And even a user agent switcher can work in most cases.\n\nThat works less and less often. Most websites nowadays do not filter on user agents at all, or at least not **only** on user agents. Instead, they check features, or even just implicitly require them by using them in their JavaScript code. As a result, if your browser is using, e.g., an LTS branch of QtWebEngine, some sites will just not work, no matter what user agent you set.\n\n>Yes, there's still Word and Photoshop and Autodesk, but enough people don't need them also.\n\nAnd there are alternatives to all of these, though those do not satisfy all users' needs. (E.g., some people are happy with GIMP, others find it missing a lot of features they use in Photoshop, and even others just cannot get used to GIMP's user interface.)\n\nThat said, if the alternative to Word is the word processor from Google Docs, that is not really an improvement. Using LibreOffice Writer is. (Note however that we are speaking only about desktops/notebooks here. LibreOffice is unfortunately mostly unusable on a phone.)\n\n>Heck, Waydroid would be perfect for a GNU/Linux phone: get the Android apps you need in a container.\n\nWaydroid is already available for GNU/Linux phones. The issue being that not all apps work in Waydroid either, for various reasons (e.g., missing hardware passthrough support for some device classes).

Both restrictions of the phone itself (locked bootloader) and missing hardware support on a Linux kernel without the Android driver stack (and without proprietary vendor drivers) can make it completely unusable.\n\nYou should be prepared to buy a dedicated device from a vendor that treats GNU/Linux as a first-class citizen (which at this time is **only PINE64 and Purism**). (Note that Furilabs is **not** such a vendor, the GNU/Linux they preinstall, FuriOS, is based on Droidian and hence on Halium, i.e., on an Android kernel with proprietary driver blobs. The same goes for Jolla's Sailfish OS for Sony devices and Volla's Ubuntu Touch phones, those are all using Halium and completely unusable without it.)\n\nWhile postmarketOS is trying really hard to support all sorts of devices, in practice, you have to get some specific old model (e.g., the long-discontinued OnePlus 6) and even then not all hardware will work (e.g., the cameras on the OnePlus 6). Many other models have almost nothing working: no calls, sometimes not even anything displayed on the screen. And those are the ones that even boot at all.\n\nWhile Halium can get more devices working, it means you are stuck on an Android kernel based on some ancient version of Linux, with proprietary drivers that often do not get upgraded and that may have critical security issues (in particular, the proprietary graphics drivers from ARM have had several critical security vulnerabilities in the last few months), and with a stack that some software just does not (or no longer) support at all (e.g., ModemManager, Plasma Mobile, etc.).

X86 platforms were written to automatically expose hardware so it could be interchangeable. RISC chips were developed for the embedded space where hardware is not interchangeable.

The company that makes a router will also make their own custom Linux build and so they don't need to or want to publish the device tree. That's also why you can't just use a generic arm build for say, a raspberry pi. Each distro must build their own pi specific build, which they can easily do because pi open sources that information.\n\nEvery smart phone vendor makes their own android build to work with their hardware (obviously excluding Apple). Technically yes, they are all using Android, but Google isn't doing the work to make Android work with every phone. Linux has benefited from x86 BIOS and uefi to maintain portability, but without that it means every distro must build a version for every soc imaginable. This would be annoying, but even more annoying is that nobody wants to play nice and share that information. They like the fact that the architecture itself can limit the ability to change OS.

For one thing, Android has ubiquitous SELinux enforcement, even for userland applications and services. Compare this to the few desktop linux distros shipping SELinux enforcing out of the box (Fedora, RHEL, and other rpm distros) and there is little comparison. On those distros, generally only system services run confined. Most userland applications run unconfined.\n\nAndroid also has a clear boundary between root and non-root, and only a handful of core services run as root. Whereas on desktop linux distros the boundary between root and non-root is very blurry. An application with non-root wheel user access is just one LD_PRELOAD attack away from getting root. \n\nAndroid also has full [verified boot](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/verifiedboot). Desktop linux distros' secure boot implementations pale in comparison, often doing fairly little.\n\nOn top of SELinux, Android has a thorough and robust application sandboxing mechanism that flatpak/snap don't even compare to. Flatpak sandbox escapes are relatively straightforward, whereas Android sandbox escapes require exploiting a [kernel vuln](https://source.android.com/docs/security/app-sandbox). You can read more at that link.\n\nI could go on but I'll leave it there. \n\nCould you use a desktop linux distro as a basis on which to build a mobile linux distribution as secure as Android? Probably a large team of engineers could over several years.\n\nWould they just be reinventing the security functionality Android has already made leaps and bounds on? Yep. \n\nI say this as a desktop linux user and the maintainer and developer of a set of [hardened desktop linux images](https://github.com/secureblue/secureblue/), the desktop linux security posture is simply leagues behind Android.

So I won\u2019t at all suggest that I know more, or you just haven\u2019t thought of XYZ, or whatever.\n\nI do, however, want to ask a couple questions from a fully sincere, actually curious pov - since I\u2019ve been a Linux sysadmin for a decade and I am always looking to learn more about these things.\n\n1. For the SELinux thing, can we just\u2026 run it in the same ubiquitous mode? Inconvenient in some aspects, surely, but convenience is always the trade off for security\n2. The line between root and non-root largely comes down to sudo using SUID, correct? Would any alternatives such as run0 (when fully ready) and/or just not giving admin access to any user facing service solve this concern?\n3. Based on what I am reading for dm-verity vs, say, the [arch Linux way of doing it](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface/Secure_Boot#Implementing_Secure_Boot), it feels largely like this comes down more to hardware limitations than software limitations - desktops are inherently meant to be modular and desktop Linux must therefore support a wide array of configurations, and there\u2019s nothing like a burnt in cryptographic key on each motherboard - because people wouldn\u2019t want their computers that locked down. Is this a reasonable assessment - I.e. that Linux could plenty viably do the same thing, if we had hardware with a burnt in cryptographic key?\n\n\nFor the sandbox\u2026 honestly, I got nothin. I mean, just based on the documentation you linked, everything it does is standardized functionality based on already existing Linux security design and unixlike permissions. Based on what I\u2019m seeing, this one is really the biggest \u201csomeone just needs to write this code for Linux.\u201d\n\nFrom what I *do* know, it certainly *feels* like the problem is a lot more \u201cthe security is literally built into the hardware\u201d and \u201capps are just built to be sandboxed by design\u201d than it is that Linux itself is the problem. It\u2019s sort of like why the movement to Wayland has been painful for certain software like screenreaders, screen recorders, and the like. The new Wayland paradigm enforces more separation between the apps than x11 did, which requires re-thinking applications like screen readers/recorders from the ground up - in some cases going all the way down to needing changes to the compositor and windows manager. Is this a somewhat fair summary, if not rather simplified? \n\nAgain, I\u2019m not questioning your knowledge, this is 100% purely \u201cthis sort of thing fascinates me, and I want to know more about it;\u201d and unfortunately I do not have any friends who have anywhere near my level of both interest *and* skill in this sort of thing, so I get very over-enthusiastic at any chance I have to discuss it with someone who actually understands and appreciates this stuff more than me. \n\nSorry if I come off as annoying, it\u2019s the ADHD lol", "subreddit": "linux", "parent_id": "t1_lqkq35q", "permalink": "/r/linux/comments/1fx5fq0/we_need_a_real_gnulinux_not_android_smartphone/lqku6dl/", "author_flair_text": ":arch:", "created_utc": 1728194689.0, "score": 6, "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "edited": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "lqny6wl", "author": "pankkiinroskaa", "body": "How do you see Windows desktops, are they also a security nightmare?", "subreddit": "linux", "parent_id": "t1_lqkq35q", "permalink": "/r/linux/comments/1fx5fq0/we_need_a_real_gnulinux_not_android_smartphone/lqny6wl/", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1728243524.0, "score": 1, "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "edited": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "lqr1sf8", "author": "AffectionatePlastic0", "body": ">Android has a thorough and robust application sandboxing mechanism\n\nUnfortunately, entire mechanism of sandboxing has a one critical flaw, any application running inside of that sandbox knows too much about it, therefore it can change it's behavior depending the restrictions added by user.\n\nYes, applications are running on separate users and have to have a permission to access to a microphone, location, camera, contact list, etc. But it doesn't matter, from my observation, average user trained to press the button \"allow\" whenever application require another permission.\n\nAs you mentioned below\n\n>Don't grant applications and services microphone access then?\n\nThan application shows something like \"The microphone access required to run The App\" and than shows permission prompt again, which will be granted by average \"trained\" user.\n\nReal recent example, I have bought Samsung earbuds, and installed a companion app. Firstly it wanted me to give it permissions to literally everything it wanted: calendar, call list, phone and even notifications. So, if user wants to use a Samsung earbuds companion app - they have to give it all the permission it wanted, even to notifications, which hilarious, because it shows a scary screen with all the warnings.\n\nThat app isn't an exception, entire Play market is flooded by, I hope, non-malignant apps which lazily implemented permission request mechanism in the way I described above. So now we have an army of users trained to press button \"allow\" whenever app asks so, because user knows - application will not run until the button \"allow\" is pressed. \n\nSo, what is the point of such \"sandboxing\" if it completely rely on goodwill of application?

Confining processes and users requires carefully constructing policies so that functionality still works. It requires tons of time and energy. Without which, we're not talking about minor inconveniences, but complete failures. If for example you try to start a gnome-shell session using a confined user on fedora, it won't even start. Fedora is making steps in the right direction on this:\n\nhttps://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/ConfinedUsers\n\nhttps://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/security-enthusiasts-wanted-from-beginners-up-to-selinux-experts-to-make-up-the-selinux-confined-users-sig-to-foster-fedoras-security-capabilities/89127\n\n> The line between root and non-root largely comes down to sudo using SUID, correct? \n\nNot exactly, although sudo being suid root isn't good either. It comes down to it being trivial to insert a fake sudo prompt or even a keylogger in the default configuration of all desktop linux distributions. https://github.com/Aishou/wayland-keylogger\n\nAny application running as the current user can simply modify the .bashrc, which is writable by the current user under which it's running.\n\nIn secureblue we provide tooling to mitigate this by setting the `chattr +i` bit on bash environment files, but it's very much a bandaid on what is otherwise a glaring architectural security problem. \n\n> Would any alternatives such as run0 (when fully ready) and/or just not giving admin access to any user facing service solve this concern?\n\nRunning a sudoless system by removing sudo in favor of  run0 is a step in the right direction, and secureblue intends to do this before the end of the year. run0 is landing in F41 via systemd 256.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that sudo is just one piece of the puzzle. With run0 you will still have to type in your wheel password in the polkit popup, which if you haven't properly secured your bash environment files is still trivial for an application running in your wheel user to keylog.\n\nOne method to counteract this is to avoid daily driving a wheel user. I've been doing this for some time now and once you get used to it, it's fine. Polkit is very useful in this regard, since for several operations (crucially, managing the system via rpm-ostree), it automatically prompts me to authenticate as my wheel user even when performing operations as and daily driving my non-wheel user. Since my running applications aren't running as that wheel user, they're unable to tamper with the wheel user's bash environment. This is documented here: https://github.com/secureblue/secureblue/blob/live/POSTINSTALL-README.md#create-a-separate-wheel-account-for-admin-purposes\n\n> Based on what I am reading for dm-verity vs, say, the arch Linux way of doing it, it feels largely like this comes down more to hardware limitations than software limitations \n\nYes, your assessment is largely correct. And I'll add that in this regard, arch linux has a leg up on Fedora, since Fedora's UKI support is still a work in progress, and sadly is nonexistent for fedora atomic.\n\nhttps://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/issues/1719\n\n> feels like the problem is a lot more \u201cthe security is literally built into the hardware\u201d \n\nThat's the case for some features like verified boot. For the others I mentioned not so much. Overhauling the permissions model, making a proper sandbox, expanding selinux, confined users, etc are all just things that need to get done, and not hardware specific.\n\n> Sorry if I come off as annoying,\n\nNot at all :)\n\nI'm not on reddit much so if you have further questions feel free to ask in our discord.

This may be a viable system, if we were using terminals with huge, multi-user systems: you run some CLI invocations and exit. \n\nBut a modern desktop userspace requires background services, apps that themselves call other apps, etc, etc. There is an old xkcd that makes fun of linux\u2019s security and it\u2019s still true to the core: https://xkcd.com/1200/\n\nAndroid *creates a new user* for each app, and makes them communicate through an IPC mechanism.

It used to be run a couple of commands, do a couple of flashes and enjoy. Now I've been sitting here for two days trying to figure out what the fuck did I fuck up during install so that Nova launcher undefaults itself on launch, some apps can't get SU access even though I'm granting it in magisk and I'm having connectivity issues, but again only on select apps (f-droid for example refuses to download anything, but I had no issue posting this comment from boost). These are not issues that should be present at all.\n\nNow should've I sideloaded the rom via adb, instead of flashing? Should I pick a different SU solution, even though people on xda say that the specific version of Magisk that Orangefox installs is working fine. If so, do I go KernelSU or Apatch? Should I switch to cr's own recovery and miss out on all the features that make a custom recovery actually useful? God only knows and I feel like it's 2012 all over again when I knew fuck about shit. \n\nOh and I wanna say, on the topic of features - the last phone I had that had an unlockable bootloader (or any aftermarket support that would make unlocking it worthwhile) was an OP3t for which cr reached EOL at android 11.  What I'm running now is A14. It really, really doesn't feel like I've gone up 3 major releases. It's more or less the same thing. Maybe even  has less features, to be fair. Material you is now native and works well, but that's it. Their theming was more than good enough back then too and they had adaptive colour schemes even then if I'm remembering correctly. \n\nSubstratum is kill afaik, so no more theming apps, if they don't get updated to follow material you. I used to be able to just load up OTGSubs and have an unified theme for my entire system in half an hour, regardless of who wanted to support what, including notoriously horrible for any modding apps, like instagram.\n\nQuite frankly, it feels like android in general has been only getting worse for the last few years and the last good version was Pie. \n\nI saw the writing on the wall when Dirty Unicorns (my all time favourite ROM) shut down and not long after AOKP, but I never thought we'd get into such a bullshit hell of terribleness packed with ununlockable bootloaders, unpublished device trees, needing very specific root solutions, no universal builds for anything, needing needing to navigate a whole jungle of modules to hide root and reestablish device integrity and so on and so forth.\n\nI mean..

For some reason, this completely nullifies the soc power management on modern laptops and can result in increases from 3W to 8W at idle!\n\nOn Intel laptops it's a bit easier to debug because you can see the Cstates in `powertop` not going low but it also wrecks AMD ones. Some laptops can reach lower cstates, but the camera module wastes a few W anyway. \n\nI can't believe this shipped in Ubuntu, Fedora etc without anyone noticing, and for so long. This bug is quite literally wasting GWh of power and destroys the user experience of distros in laptops. \n\nIf you have a laptop with a switch that detaches the camera from the usb bus you are probably out of the water, just plug it when you use it and the problem is sidestepped. Removing uvcvideo and modprobing it on demand can also work. Disabling the camera in Lenovo's UEFI is what I did for a year until I finally found the issue on the tracker. *Some* laptops also seem to not be affected, but for me it happens to every machine I've tested.   \n\nThanks to [this](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/pipewire/-/issues/2669#note_2362342) comment for another workaround that tells wireplumber to ignore cameras.\n`~/.config/wireplumber/wireplumber.conf.d/10-disable-camera.conf`\n\n\n    wireplumber.profiles = {\n      main = {\n        monitor.libcamera = disabled\n      }\n    }\n    \nSoftware that only captures *cameras* using pipewire is rare and this hasn't given me any problem.\nThis should probably be shipped by distros while the problem is sorted out.\n\nNote that most laptops will have other problems stopping them from reaching deep cstates, borked pcie sd card readers, ancient ethernet nics that don't support pcie sleep properly, outdated nvme firwmare... those are separate issues that most of the time can also be tackled with some dose of tlp, but it's all for nothing if the usb camera is keeping the soc awake!\n\nEDIT:\nhttps://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/pipewire/-/issues/2669#note_2525226\nThey're working on fixing it :D", "comments": [{"id": "lgx4nry", "author": "Octopus0nFire", "body": "Workaround was successful for my Thinkpad E14 gen2.

They also might find it hard to justify blocking an entire LTS release because a subset of users will have code that works but just uses too much power.\n\nIt's also true that oftentimes corporations that make platforms have commitments (formal and informal) with their partners and these partners can be promised that a certain platform will be released by _dateX_ and so there's a huge internal incentive to actually hit _dateX_ so as to not screw up the timeline the partner set because you told them that's when the next major version release was going to be.", "subreddit": "linux", "parent_id": "t1_lgxl4ng", "permalink": "/r/linux/comments/1em8biv/psa_pipewire_has_been_halving_your_battery_life/lgxnc79/", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1723036664.0, "score": 2, "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "edited": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "lh37lm7", "author": "ImpossibleEdge4961", "body": "The testing involved is going to be too detail oriented and too expensive to really be done entirely pro bono. Part of the reason this did happen was specifically because it's just a hard thing to actually do correctly and none of the community projects at play had testing that caught this confluence of hardware configuration and non-obvious software behavior.\n\nUsing the OP as an example, it's easy to determine that problem exists for certain hardware users because you know exactly what kind of hardware to be looking at and exactly what part of the system to be looking at. It's harder to develop a testing regime that enumerates all possible areas where an issue might crop up. Because in order to do that you need many _many_ consumer devices and a standardized way of testing each one that incorporates the cumulative result of just iteratively expanding the testing out.\n\nBasically when you're releasing an entire operations full integration testing is a very intensive process because there's an almost innumerable amount of possible permutations on a wide variety of hardware and software configurations. This is just something you have to have some sort of funding for and desktop GNU/Linux just doesn't really have the funding for it.\n\nWhich is why you _don't_ see this issue on GNU/Linux systems like framework where running Linux is part of the sales pitch.

Hello?\n\nNeither of which make an appreciable amount of money off desktop users. The revenue for Linux comes almost entirely from the server and embedded spaces. \n\nThere just isn't a general revenue model for desktop users outside of just supporting desktop for the sake of mindshare. RH and Canonical's incentive is just to get you to think they're really cool people who care a lot about the community and just like making quality software.\n\nThere are enterprise workstation users but it's share of overall revenue might not even crack a single percent for either company.\n\n> Pipewire was literally created within the walls of Red Hat,\n\nWell RH has an open source first approach so it wouldn't have been made \"within the walls\" of the company. It was made within the walls of Wims's house and RH is willing to dedicate _some_ amount of resources towards developer hours. Still not much but also not zero dollars.\n\n> Who was supposed to test that software, gee, I wonder.\n\nWell even pipewire doesn't get the testing being referred to (that's why the bug in the OP happened). The Pipewire team can test on whatever hardware they have at their disposal but to do this kind of testing properly it takes a lot of different hardware platforms running a variety of different OS versions (including probably different distributions).\n\nThe reason is because you never know what weird combination of software versioning, user behavior, hardware configuration, system configuration, and/or compile-time build options is going to trigger undesirable behavior. You don't need to be completely exhaustive of all the different possible comninations a customer might try to put your software into but you do need a broad continuum of permutations so that hopefully if the software is doing something wrong it eventually shows up somewhere in your testing. This is just the generally accepted idea of roughly what you need to do when you claim to be exhaustively testing your software. \n\nObviously, without a direct and at least somewhat popular organizational revenue stream that all this effort is meant to support you won't get a company that actually does this. Canonical does a bit, RH does a bit, IIRC the Linux Foundation does a bit as well. But until there's some sort of business case to make it just won't happen. This often happens in a large variety of ways with software critical for server functionality but there's no business case to make to test desktop software to this degree.\n\nFor example, even to just account for problems with nvidia drivers (supposing you were testing that) you would need a large array of different model nvidia cards on a variety of systems (like AMD vs Intel) and then run tests on what are basically 10-20 different permutations of hardware and software configuration and _even then_ you've only account for weird interactions between \n\nAnd if you look at what is actually in the OP: it's a silent error that only happens on certain platforms running affected versions of Pipewire. Which is why this slipped through when other organizations like Apple or Microsoft probably would have caught it (because they _do_ have an incentive).\n\nThe closest you get to a reasonable amount of testing on desktop GNU/Linux would probably be Chromebooks. But that's because they don't need to test a wide array of possible hardware, just Chromebook hardware. They don't need to test a wide variety of software and platform versioning, just several reasonably current versions of ChromeOS. On top of that they _do_ have a financial stake in making sure the platform software works fine for desktop users. Surprise surprise, Chromebooks don't have these random corner cases crop up nearly that often either.\n\nThis is also why \"works on my machine\" is such a common joke about desktop software on Linux. There's just a broad at least faint recognition that they just fundamentally can't test all the scenarios they probably would like to be able to test.\n\nI would definitely like it if desktop Linux did get that funding but it just doesn't make financial sense given the offerings on the market.", "subreddit": "linux", "parent_id": "t1_lhjb4rg", "permalink": "/r/linux/comments/1em8biv/psa_pipewire_has_been_halving_your_battery_life/lhllk96/", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1723389573.0, "score": 1, "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "edited": 1723389959.0, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "lgxoy04", "author": "p4block", "body": "I think this issue may also happen to windows on a probably smaller subset of machines.

But it simply isn't a defect or malfunction, it was arguably a (bad) conscious choice by the vendor/manufacturer.

Many things a user can override and configure differently.\nThat may or may not void any warranty or guarantees that a company may have and can make.\n\n\nOf course those things can potentially be exploited, doing so may be illegal if caught\u2026 but still physically possible.\nLike all those usb sticks which happen to fry a computer, or install some logging software etc.\nOr charging ports that then read all your data on your phone.\n\nIn some cases, like webcam lights, there is a hardware solution to fix the potential privacy bypass.

{"subreddit": "linux", "id": "u6yx12", "title": "Today my Debian installation turns 21!!", "author": "elivs", "body": "Today my Debian installation turns 21!! Its finally an adult.\n\nI started using Linux in the late '90s through various flavors of Redhat and Mandrake. Then in early 2001 when I bought a new hard drive I decided to try Debian. It was known to be a little harder to get configured than other distributions, but I was told the maintainability was worth the effort.\n\nSince then I've dist-upgraded for 21 years!\n\nDuring this 21 years the underlying hardware has changed many times from 20Gb hard-drives, ISA-modems, and graphics cards with nearly impossible to install drivers.\n\nThe machine was installed with Potato (Debian2.2). For a while it was my only desktop computer. Then later it became the living room computer with web browsers, email, photos, video, and music. It now sits in a cupboard running websites, firewall, code repositories, openvpn servers, mail servers, backup servers (backuppc etc), and fileservers (samba, NFS etc).\n\nThe system has moved technologies like ext2, to ext4 on LVMS; from 32bit libraries to 64bit multiarch. (The 32bit to 64bit migration was the hardest upgrade I ever had to do.)\n\nCongratulations to the Debian team for producing an unbelievably maintainable system!\n\nThe best way I found to confirm the installation time is to use the stat command to look at when root's mail file was created:\n\n    root@elivs:~# hostname\n    elivs\n    root@elivs:~# stat /root/mail\n      File: /root/mail\n      Size: 4096            Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   directory\n    Device: fe00h/65024d    Inode: 24380195    Links: 2\n    Access: (0700/drwx------)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root)\n    Access: 2022-04-18 03:46:13.475697168 +1200\n    Modify: 2001-04-18 17:34:55.000000000 +1200\n    Change: 2020-01-04 15:27:58.530005632 +1300\n     Birth: 2020-01-04 15:27:58.530005632 +1300\n\n**There have been a few  questions that keep coming up:**\n\n**Why?**\n\nEssentially, the install is so old because I'm lazy.\n\nI want my machines to be a tool that continues to work when I need it. I don't have time to spend on lots of home sysadmin.\n\nDist-upgrading is usually faster than re-installing then reconfiguring. Once  you've done a certain amount of configuration of services and tools it  tends to be easier to upgrade than do a clean reinstall. For example, I think I've only had to re-configure Samba 1-3 times over 15 years. Otherwise the samba config seems to migrate fine with each dist-upgrade and so it keep serving files to the family's other computers.\n\nThere  will be some \"cruft\" with packages that I've installed but no longer use. However there are tools for finding obsolete packages. The biggest mess is my \\~/.\\* directories from user land tools that I no longer have installed. While this is messy it doesn't effect system performance. At some stage I should sort through this - right after I tidy my garden shed.\n\nAs I said, it's a tribute to Debian packaging system that upgrades have been easier than reinstalls.\n\n**32 to 64 bit**\n\nIt was an cross-grade from 32 to 64 bit using multi-arch. There are instructions here: [https://wiki.debian.org/CrossGrading](https://wiki.debian.org/CrossGrading)\n\nBy  the time I wanted to move from 32bit to 64bit, I had so many services  running I would have had to spend hours re-configuring them all on a  fresh install. I guess I could have copied all the config files, but I'm  not sure that would be much faster.\n\nIn  the end, when I bought a new disk I copied the system (not /home) to  the new disk - so the old disk became the backup. I followed the  instructions on cross-grading. There was lots of downloading and  re-install of each package's new binaries, but this is all done without  user intervention. The first time it failed because I presumably did  something wrong. Second time it worked well.\n\nThus,  overall it was probably only a few hundred key strokes to migrate from 32bit to 64bit. Much much faster than a re-install and re-configuring  packages.\n\n**Other**\n\nThis particular machine has been tracking \"stable\" for most of its life. Dist-upgrades have therefore been relatively pain free.\n\nThere  have been a few minor hick-ups with deep system changes. Eg  lilo to  grub where I had to manually make the transition, but that was a good  time to move from \"legacy\" boot to efi.\n\nUsually  with these sort of deep system changes you have 1-2 releases of Debian  to make the transition, rather than shifting when it's first introduced.  Often by the time I make the transition I've already been using the new technology on other machines. Plus, by that stage there will be plenty of How-Tos and  tutorials. For example, there was no urgency in switching from SysV init scripts to systemd - I could simply transition when I was familiar with systemd from other machines.\n\nThe trick, if anything, is that machine never uses bleeding edge technologies. I have other machines for that.\n\n&#x200B;", "comments": [{"id": "i5br8ju", "author": "i_am_at_work123", "body": "So this is a unique case of [the ship of Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus) (or Trigger's broom if you prefer).\n\nCongrats OP!", "subreddit": "linux", "parent_id": "t3_u6yx12", "permalink": "/r/linux/comments/u6yx12/today_my_debian_installation_turns_21/i5br8ju/", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1650365142.0, "score": 211, "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "edited": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "i5bn9gj", "author": "garyvdm", "body": "Nice!  \n\n\nI'm very proud of my 9yo Arch Linux instillation.

On the one hand, developers look back on their older work, declare \"Fuck, what idiot wrote this?\" and write something new to fix their prior crimes, to be more correct, and view backwards compatibility as an inconvenience (after all, app devs can just recompile for ABI breaks and rewrite for API breaks, every few months for every lib). And on the other hand, nobody has the staffing (i.e. money) to either maintain multiple versions of libraries within a distro, or to keep bad or broken API forever in the name of compatibility.\n\nIt's a grind for app developers, who need to keep releasing and releasing and releasing if they want their app to keep building against new versions of libraries whose APIs are unstable (see also: iOS developers). And releasing multiple simultaneous binary versions if they want to ship binaries. Heck, forget all the wrongheaded talk of dynamic vs static linking - what ends up being the only sane solution is a \\`dlopen()\\` based shim to handle every ABI version of the libs you consume, at a cost of startup performance - moving the burden of maintaining things to the app developer rather than the lib developer.\n\nMusl won't save you, it just brings you new problems (and breaks support with 100% of your existing apps, avoidance of which is the whole point of this discussion). Static linking won't help you (especially for parts like GPU drivers, which do not like this at all). What you need, as an ISV, is to be able to rely on your core libraries enough to ship something.

The old behavior was the glibc would ignore these overrides and just do what it thought was best (include DT_HASH).\n\nNow glibc has decided to just follow whatever the build options are. So if Arch told glibc to not include DT_HASH glibc will actually not include the DT_HASH anymore, exactly like Arch intended.\n\nAnd this resulted in a missing DT_HASH which broke shit.

Apologies, let me try again.\n\nCurrently, the world is dominated by a closed-source operating system, and there is no way Windows would become free software (not to even mention its other problems like privacy). Logic says that GNU would rather have Linux and/or other free software OSes to win over it. For that to happen, we need to find a fix for things that are holding Linux back.\n\nOne of these areas is gaming. Even if GNU does not care about it, it is one of the dominoes that needs to fall, for more Linux market share. As a result, more users will be there, the more support Linux gets from everyone, and in return, in ideal world, open source operating system becomes the standard while Windows gets deprecated.\n\nOf course, such way of thinking is not without its risks. For example, I am not sure I would say something along the lines of \"Chromebooks should be cheered on by GNU, because this advances Linux as a desktop\" - Google has simply too many privacy problems and makes people depend on it too much, while Chromebooks are not exactly advancing \"desktop Linux\" rather than Chrome browser and Google services.\n\nCompared to Google, Valve is just a company that has a games store, pretty good ethics for a game company (apart from making money from gambling, which I don't like too much myself...), and since quite a few years works directly to make Linux a proper operating system for gaming. Sure, they do it for their own goals, but since these are defined as \"provide an open market alternative to Windows ecosystem\", it seems it aligns well (at least for now) with what GNU or open source community would like to happen.", "subreddit": "linux", "parent_id": "t1_iknci8k", "permalink": "/r/linux/comments/wq9ag2/valve_employee_glibc_not_prioritizing/iknpjd7/", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1660745290.0, "score": 6, "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "edited": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "ikmvreg", "author": "ouyawei", "body": "Many applications rely on GNU extensions that are not provided by Musl.", "subreddit": "linux", "parent_id": "t1_ikmofld", "permalink": "/r/linux/comments/wq9ag2/valve_employee_glibc_not_prioritizing/ikmvreg/", "author_flair_text": ":ubuntu: Mate", "created_utc": 1660728582.0, "score": 17, "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "edited": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "iksyycg", "author": "AcridWings_11465", "body": "Linus promised syscall stability, not that.", "subreddit": "linux", "parent_id": "t1_ikoiw4b", "permalink": "/r/linux/comments/wq9ag2/valve_employee_glibc_not_prioritizing/iksyycg/", "author_flair_text": ":fedora:", "created_utc": 1660835305.0, "score": 2, "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "edited": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "iknqsve", "author": "Pjb3005", "body": "> the NT kernel has an unstable syscall interface while Linux has a stable one, which is why statically linked musl and flatpak glibc work so well.\n\nKernel32.dll is not unstable and it effectively *is* the syscall interface on Windows.

By the way, when calling someone else dense you might want to avoid simple grammar mistakes otherwise it loses some of its impact.\n\n> That\u2019s just false. \n\nWhat specifically are you saying is false?\n\n> Defaults tell you what a base level of configuration should be enough to get you running in a relatively good state under the auspices of what they plan and continue to support.\n\nGenerally speaking, defaults don't have anything at all to do with what the developers of software support or plan to continue supporting. They are simply values/features that are targeted at the typical use case for their software.\n\nProbably the most common reason for things to be optional (and therefore require a default in the first place) is when there's some sort of tradeoff required to support the feature _and_ the developer believes a high percentage of people will be paying the cost for the feature while not realizing the benefit.\n\nI can even give you a concrete example from a project I'm working on: a dictionary/word segmentation library for Chinese text that generates the data as source that can be directly compiled into an application. I plan to to also support Cantonese, but the tradeoff here is that including the Cantonese data is going to increase the size of the binary, memory usage, etc. So the default features probably won't compile in the Cantonese support - most people won't need it, and there's no reason to make them pay that cost when there's no benefit.\n\nHowever, this doesn't mean I want to _discourage_ anyone from utilizing the Cantonese support in the library. It doesn't mean I intend to remove support in the future. There's no value judgement implied in that it's provided as an option rather than enabled by default. I'd just be targeting the typical use case.\n\n> It\u2019s saying \u201chere\u2019s a baseline that you should expect to always work normally\u201d.\n\nSure, the defaults should be reasonable. I'm not arguing with that at all. Although in this case, I'm not really sure if it's all that unreasonable since probably the majority of glibc users _aren't_ playing EAC games on desktop Linux. That being the case, distributions aimed at that type of user can enable the option.\n\nWhat I disagreed with was you saying that the defaults _imply_ something about the way the developer wants or intends the software to be used, which just isn't the case.", "subreddit": "linux", "parent_id": "t1_ikntcjd", "permalink": "/r/linux/comments/wq9ag2/valve_employee_glibc_not_prioritizing/iko0c0a/", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1660749570.0, "score": 2, "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "edited": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "ikpk5yf", "author": "nulld3v", "body": "No, look how Arch explicitly tells the compiler to NOT include DT_HASH when building programs: https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wq9ag2/valve_employee_glibc_not_prioritizing/ikmnaon\n\nAnd for a long time glibc ignored that.

At least as far as I can tell.\n\nFoss focuses on user control and ownership. Publishers especially tend to lean towards publisher control over the media in question. Needless to say: These views are incompatible.\n\nNot developing for Linux is the cheaper, easier option to ensure your schemes won't be obliterated by poking around users. Not to mention - \\~2% of the desktop market makes it tiny, relative to the amount of work it takes to develop for it.\n\n**And so we get to**\n\nSo if you really want compatibility: What is the best way? And we really have three methods:\n\n* Translation / Compatibility layer\n* Containers\n* Full virtualization\n\nMicrosoft already does the compatibility thing. \n\nAnd the Irony is, Microsoft is big enough that they could push for AMD and NVIDIA to provide the ability to have ONE virtual GPU for the Host, and ONE virtual GPU for their VM off each GPU - and once done, a stripped down say WindowsXP VM that runs basically in the back ground could be used to run older games and other software - in a sandbox.\n\n**Why I view this as a BETTER solution**\n\nThe reason? Security. By not relying on the OS itself to provide compatibility, you don't need features baked in to enable it. And this trims down complexity.\n\nBeyond this - it means compatibility layers can become an enitre piece of the puzzle that can be targeted for optimization, but also something that can have an array of options for the users to tune for each piece of software, create profiles, and share said profiles to make it easier.\n\nSimpler OS, clear definition of software roll and so on: Fixes issues. And lets face it: Windows is WAY to bloated right now.\n\n>I'm not certain that it would be just as easy to run a same-era Linux-compatible game on a modern installation.\n\n*looks at what will run on Linux these days vs a decade ago.*\n\nIf you said this a decade or so ago: Sure.

This is obviously a subjective opinion but a few examples:\n\n* The icons are inconsistent.  When selecting whether the letter will be bold, underlined, or in italics, open office will randomly switch from a double-story 'a' to a single story 'a'.   [[OO Icons](http://i.imgur.com/MdlMYlW.png)]\n* The icons could be more descriptive: Use a Bold B for bold, an Italic I for italics, and underlined U for underline.  \n* Too many randomly selected colors in the UI. \n* The icons are outlined.  That type of design makes it feel old.  It would look cleaner if they are only one color.  The icons are bulky and ugly.  Compare those same icons above with the google docs icons: [Google Docs Icons](http://i.imgur.com/I3lNywy.png)\n* Too many colors in the task bar.  \n* Icons are huge, taking up screen real estate.  \n* Gradients tend to look dated. \n* The fonts used in icons are inconsistent (the letters use one font, the list items use another font, spell check uses another font)\n* The font selection for the icons is a bad one.  \n* The lines are too thick in all the line icons.  [OO align](http://i.imgur.com/qqgknl3.png)\n* Many icons are difficult to understand: Shadow icon barely casts a shadow, outline looks like it would be a change color icon.  Hyperlink too zoomed in and inconsistent with the look of the other icons.  \n* There's too many icons, which makes it more difficult to find the icons you use 80% of the time.  Some pre-selected icons shouldn't be there: Shadow, and outline, for example.  \n* There's a dead space between the ruler and the icons. \n* The icons are not grouped, they're just all thrown out there and divided by a very subtle line.  That makes it more difficult to find an icon.  \n\n\nRemoving some icons, making them consistent, smaller, more modern looking, more intuitive, using less colors and no gradients/outlines, choosing better fonts for the icons, and giving each group its space would go a long way towards making open office look more modern.

Thus, iteration; but iteration can only happen when enough people complain, and I think it's a fair argument that people won't complain if they never realize they can do something. And one way to make it possible to see that something exists is through prototyping.\n\nWordPerfect had a \"show style codes\" option that popped up a pane in the bottom half of the screen showing WP's internal formatting system's direct representation of the document. You could edit it (mostly using the backspace key :P), and WP's choice to expose internal state in this way made fixing bizarre formatting issues/errors viable (although not easy).\n\nI've always considered this feature incredibly cool, and I think it would be revolutionary for LO to take this idea to the next level and make it possible to add new styles directly to the style tree (with sane input validation).

And sometimes the codebases differ so much that your integration code cannot support certain features without thousands of lines of boilerplate code to make everything continue to work correctly.\n\nFor a large, volunteer project like LibreOffice, who do not put high focus on the UI, this will never scale and will fall apart horribly very quickly.\n\nSecondly, there comes a point where, in order to add functionality or usability that looks and/or works better and/or makes more sense or whatnot, you sometimes have to make large, decisive steps in a particular direction in order to bring about the change you're trying to accomplish.\n\nAn example of where this can cause issues is the Windows start menu, a fairly arbitrary construction that accidentally hung around for 10 years. Microsoft tried to ditch it in order to move forward, but went too far initially then had to iterate to find a compromise that people could still relate to. I think the middle ground M$ has reached is certainly workable.\n\nAnother example: the Linux kernel entered version 2.6 in late 2003. It was an incredibly major upgrade, adding significant new architecture and capabilities to the system. And then everything entered a stalemate: as the years passed, nothing major happened to Linux on the scale that prompted a version increment to 2.6 from 2.4, and 2.4 from 2.2. Eventually Linus got mad and arbitrarily decided to switch the versioning policy in 2011 after seeing 2.6.x release after 2.6.x release over the course of 7 years, and now the kernel's major version increments at a more comfortable speed. My point is [Linus' way of describing the version bump](https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/5/29/204): \"...I'm just going all\nalpha-male, and just renumbering it. You'll like it.\"\n\nSometimes it takes that kind of change. Sure, you have to iterate a bit afterwards in some cases. But that's true progression.", "subreddit": "linux", "parent_id": "t1_cxbu0wt", "permalink": "/r/linux/comments/3u2p7x/tired_of_the_1990s_look_of_libreoffice_heres_how/cxdl7q9/", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1448531918.0, "score": 2, "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "edited": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "cxbfcs3", "author": "Unknown", "body": "You'd also have to search through all the menus and hope you picked the right one.

It's great as a practice GUI project, but isn't very usable for downloading videos. I'm going to talk specifically about YouTube videos, which is what most people would use it for. Most of the problems below would be solved by running `youtube-dl -F <url>` and letting the user pick from that, rather than generic format/quality options that aren't intercompatible.\n\nFor audio, you can choose `aac`/`flac`/`mp3`/`opus`/`wav` at 0/2/5/8 quality. **No matter which you choose, it will download the largest audio file and convert it.** (This is why `--audio-format` and `--audio-quality` are listed under 'post-processing' in the youtube-dl docs.) On YT this is usually 128kbps M4A file, because the 160kbps Opus file is VBR.\n\n* **AAC:** it will rename the `.m4a` to `.aac`, ignoring your quality options.\n* **MP3:** it will transcode the M4A to MP3. This is the only time the quality options work: at best/good/medium/low, it will use 192/128/96/64kbps. Transcoding 128 to 192 is questionable, and [it's not ideal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_loss) to use the lower-quality source file, but if you just want low-quality MP3s then the tool isn't too bad.\n* **Opus:** it will transcode the M4A to Opus. Opus doesn't understand the quality number: at good/medium/low it tries to encode at 2/5/8kbps (completely unusable). 'best' is OK quality (around 100kbps VBR), but nowhere near as good as the 160k Opus available directly from YouTube.\n* **FLAC/WAV:** it will ignore the quality option (what would that even mean?) and decode your audio into >1000kbps for no reason.\n\nThere are four video buttons (`3gp`/`flv`/`mp4`/`webm`), but YouTube only supports three video codecs: h264, vp9, av1. `3gp` and `flv` are legacy codecs, these buttons are useless; and h264/av1 both use `mp4`, so you can't even choose between the three.\n\nIt has a very poor way of choosing a download, first looking for (format=F, height=H) and then (height<H, max filesize). This gives some weird behaviour:\n\n* You want 720p mp4, but the video is 18:9 aspect. The file you want is actually 1280\u00d7640, which doesn't match `mp4[height=720]`. So it moves onto `bestvideo[height<=720]`, and downloads the 720p webm.\n* You want 1080p webm, but the video is 21:9 aspect. It checks for `webm[height=1080]` and downloads the 1440p file, which is 2560\u00d71080.\n* You want an unsupported format: maybe `flv` or high-res `mp4` (YT only has vp9, sometimes av1 at >1080p). `flv[height=1080]` never matches, so it uses `bestvideo[height<=1080]` to download the largest file within the resolution.", "subreddit": "linux", "parent_id": "t3_kyw5jx", "permalink": "/r/linux/comments/kyw5jx/a_simpletouse_graphical_interface_for_youtubedl/gjkw9zk/", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1610888252.0, "score": 4, "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "edited": 1610889021.0, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "gjkff0f", "author": "Unknown", "body": "[deleted]", "subreddit": "linux", "parent_id": "t3_kyw5jx", "permalink": "/r/linux/comments/kyw5jx/a_simpletouse_graphical_interface_for_youtubedl/gjkff0f/", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1610881009.0, "score": 1, "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "edited": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "gjkwqdp", "author": "fx-6300", "body": "Thanks !!!", "subreddit": "linux", "parent_id": "t3_kyw5jx", "permalink": "/r/linux/comments/kyw5jx/a_simpletouse_graphical_interface_for_youtubedl/gjkwqdp/", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1610888512.0, "score": 0, "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "edited": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "gjjuqbw", "author": "LevAsmanov", "body": "But youtube-dl is dead...

It's a volunteer effort only.\n\nThe first thing that is important to understand is the difference between Epiphany and WebKitGtk.\n\n - Epiphany is a web browser, but does not include the rendering engine\n - The rendering engine (WebKit) is millions of lines of code and primarily maintained by Apple, with Igalia doing most of the Gtk work I believe\n - Epiphany is about 40,000 lines of C (not including tests or shared components) and written like a plain old GTK application\n\nNow, for a bit of a history lesson\n\n - Epiphany pre-dates Firefox, and it used to be called Galeon (released June 2000)\n - Many years ago, GNOME created gtkmozembed for Mozilla, an embeddable HTML widget based on gecko\n - Epiphany/Galeon used to use this embeddable widget\n - Mozilla discontinued that project, thereby abandoning the \"embedded HTML widget\" community\n\nThere are many reasons to need an embeddable HTML widget in a platform. I don't think anyone needs convincing of that.\n\nSo there was a bit of an impasse. Mozilla did not want (it's unclear if they do now) an embeddable widget. Yet applications require one and the toolkit better damn well ship one that works.\n\nYou're unlikely to get good testing of an embeddable HTML widget unless you have applications testing it. So there needs to be *something* that gets enough testing to shake out bugs.\n\nFurthermore, gecko has not been very good over the years at various features that down-streams needed\n\n - Reliable hardware and software compositing\n - GStreamer based codecs, which is a major component of the desktop, mobile, and embedded platforms enablement\n - Workable on low-power devices such as Raspberry Pi (a major driver of webkitgtk I believe)\n - Native widgets, it should match the rest of the UI\n - Wayland support\n - Support touch, gestures, multi-touch, smooth scrolling\n - Proxy integration with the platform\n - Hooks for adblocking and safety\n - Certificate store integration\n\nI can probably think of more, but I'm neither a WebKitGtk or Epiphany contributor.\n\nAlso, consider the complexity and time involved. For a very small number of contributors, maintaining the shell around WebKitGtk is not a terribly difficult amount of effort. The amount of effort to do that same work inside something the size of Firefox would take considerably more people. So transferring that effort into the behemoth that is Mozilla would have a few downsides in the short term.\n\n - Their work would take much longer to ship, due to the complex support matrix of Firefox. A number of people in our community have, or currently work at Mozilla. Ask them, they know how much of a pain it is.\n - It would take more people than we have currently contributing\n - It would mean less testing for our HTML embedding widget\n\nAnd finally, all the distros ship Firefox by default anyway.\nSo it's not like Epiphany is the preferred browser.\nIt's more like a reference implementation for the platform.\n\nI'm sure I missed some things, but this should at least give you an idea.", "subreddit": "linux", "parent_id": "t3_65ioil", "permalink": "/r/linux/comments/65ioil/why_doesnt_gnome_contribute_directly_to_firefox/dgbq75k/", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1492319998.0, "score": 130, "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "edited": 1492321860.0, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "dgakmep", "author": "Unknown", "body": "[deleted]", "subreddit": "linux", "parent_id": "t3_65ioil", "permalink": "/r/linux/comments/65ioil/why_doesnt_gnome_contribute_directly_to_firefox/dgakmep/", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1492257571.0, "score": 287, "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "edited": 1495160025.0, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "dgam18v", "author": "Tireseas", "body": "Part of your problem is that you're assuming it's all one big community and everyone has the same goals.

A healthy open-source ecosystem is constantly swinging back and forth between a de facto standard implementation and a chaotic mess of multiple competing implementations. This cycle looks something like:\n\n- There is one canonical solution to a given problem.\n- The solution matures and reaches an optimum.\n- The situation changes: new technology becomes available, new insights in software design, language theory, or whatever appear, new requirements become commonplace, etc.\n- The canonical solution, being mature and stable, has a hard time adapting to the new situation, and as a result, its suitability decreases.\n- At some point, the canonical solution becomes painful to use, and new solutions pop up.\n- Initially, the new solutions are immature and experiments, so the old one remains in place for a while.\n- Eventually, two or three leaders emerge (sometimes including a massively overhauled version of the original solution) and start battling it out.\n- Social dynamics amplify advantages and disadvantages, even if those are based on social inertia (having the right initial user base) rather than technical merits (being the technically superior solution)\n- Eventually, one of the leaders becomes the new de facto standard, and the others retreat into niches, resort to extreme simplification, merge into the standard solution, or get abandoned.\n\nGiven this background, what we're seeing is that Epiphany is retreating into a niche - it's not going to become a mainstream browser, but most the technology used in it is also used for other things in GNOME / GTK, the extra effort of maintaining Epiphany as a barebones browser isn't large, and it provides a good testing playground for all the other stuff. Having a web view component is useful for a lot of things that aren't technically web browsers (consider things like email clients, feed readers, built-in help systems, etc.), so the whole web stuff needs to be maintained anyway; a browser, even if it's barebones and nowhere near competitive, is a useful thing to have, even if it's just to easily test the components it shares with the greater ecosystem.\n\nMeaning that \"developing a good web browser\" probably isn't the most important goal for Epiphany; the real goals lie elsewhere, and abandoning Epiphany and contributing to Firefox instead would not help those goals.", "subreddit": "linux", "parent_id": "t3_65ioil", "permalink": "/r/linux/comments/65ioil/why_doesnt_gnome_contribute_directly_to_firefox/dgaoyws/", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1492266259.0, "score": 65, "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "edited": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "dgbbtum", "author": "saichampa", "body": "The fact that epiphany uses WebKit means that it doesn't have to be a huge project.

The major (as in, seeing widespread use) general-purpose distros today roughly amount to \"Debian/Ubuntu\" and \"RHEL/Fedora\", iow., `apt` and `yum`. These two families, I believe, make up 90% of the server install base today.\n\nAnd also because in the case of distros, divergence is arguably more valuable than convergence. If all distros were to merge into one, what exactly would we win? Things are pretty damn compatible already, just because I run Debian and you run Gentoo doesn't mean I can't run your programs or SSH into your machine or whatever; the extra value of unifying distros is small, but the extra value of choice, in this arena, is large, especially if you consider that in those areas where unification does have benefits (e.g., security consideration on core parts of the OS), it does actually happen (e.g., Ubuntu inherits quite a bit from Debian).\n\n> Second point, your model underlies unlimited resources, which we don't have. We plainly have not the ressources in user attention, time, money and developers to scattering them on so many half-baked alternatives on multiple crucical fronts.\n\nMaybe so, but the alternative is strictly worse. And your argument is broken anyway, in multiple ways, even:\n\n- Man-hours are not a valid metric; if 10 people can maintain 10 projects, then putting the same 10 people on 1 project doesn't enable them to develop that project 10 times faster or 10 times better.\n- This all being done in the open, and with free licensing, 10 people working on 10 projects doesn't mean work being done on project A is worthless for project B; people copy from competitors all the time, and unlike the proprietary world, the free/open culture actively encourages this. Canonical putting all that work into Unity? Some of it goes down the drain now, sure, but some of it did make its way into other projects, and lessons learned from Unity were learned in public, and anyone who wants to can benefit from them.\n- How else are we supposed to test out new ideas? You seem to think that the purpose of an open source release is to ship a finished product and attract lots of users, but a more accurate description is probably that you have an idea, you build a minimum viable implementation, and then you throw it out in the wild to see whether it flies, and if it does, you go see how far. \"Release early, release often\" is the mantra, and it is crucial to developing software collectively.\n\n> On the other side, the Linux kernel project is successful for one reason: focussing the limited resources with ironfist into on goal driven development path, ultimately decided by Torvalds. We need more of that for FOSS being successful.\n\nLinux is very much not goal-driven, and IIRC, Linus himself has said something along the lines of \"the reason Linux is so successful is because there never was a plan or a goal; people just added things that were useful to them, and I merged them in\". There isn't a long-term plan for Linux, other than \"keep the code maintainable and add features that people want\". Linux isn't planned, or controlled, in a way it just happens. The iron fist you mention does exist, but it's not about the Grand Plan (which doesn't exist), it's just about keeping things sane and maintainable.", "subreddit": "linux", "parent_id": "t1_dgdb9yc", "permalink": "/r/linux/comments/65ioil/why_doesnt_gnome_contribute_directly_to_firefox/dge8nuk/", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1492468399.0, "score": 1, "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "edited": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "dgbsfga", "author": "CODESIGN2", "body": "Really?

Not \"KDE-only\", I'll use your terminology. Not that it matters. \n\nKrita is great. The program meets basic requirements for a pro workflow (32bit float per color channel, nondestructive editing with adjustment layers, and industry standard HDR output files). Unlike GIMP, for example, primarily because GIMP lacks HDRI color gamuts (in the experimental release) and nondestructive editing (slated for 3.2). Krita does that now. And it exports in an industry standard HDR format with layers (OpenEXR). \n\nBut alone, while Krita is nice, it's no rationale to switch platforms. It is not a killer app. For that Linux will need a whole tool chain. \n\nLets add Inkscape. Because it's the only free vector editor that comes close to producing professional output.  \n\nSo, if you want to paint and do vector graphics for design, you need _both_ Krita and Inkscape. And Inkscape happens to be built against GTK2. Thus, for a viable workflow, BOTH KDE and Gnome \"Framework\" toolkits must be installed. Heresy! They don't even work well together! \n\nBut Krita and Inkscape alone aren't much. In the Adobe world, that would be Photoshop and Illustrator. Nobody buys just those two apps. \n\nLet's add Blender. Because it also supports 32bit float per color channel and OpenEXR file formats. And what does it do? It's a 3D mesh editor with a materials node editor that handles PBR photorealistic rendering. There are rigging tools for 3D and 2D puppets. And motion tracking with 3D and 2D node compositing for VFX. It has excellent text and motion graphics effects with the Animation Nodes addon. An NLE video editor.  It's adequate though not great for color grading (use Natron). And it outputs OpenEXR as part of a pro pipeline. \n\nOnly problem: It doesn't use _either_ QT or GTK. They do their own thing for widgets in OpenGL. That doesn't conform to either KDE or Gnome! And yet it's the most important creative desktop app available for Linux.  \n\nBut hey, let's not stop there. Because if you want to composite and color grade, you won't really want to use Blender. There's a better tool: Natron. It's basically a Nuke clone. That actually does use QT. So, perhaps part of the \"KDE-Framework\". Like it matters. It has all the wide color gamut and OpenEXR bells and whistles. Plus a whole bunch of awesome compositing nodes to use with its node editor. \n\nThis basically covers Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, a chunk of After Effects, and Maya. \n\nTo complete the AE+Animate tools in Adobe land, you'll need OpenToonz. Which is absolutely a pro quality 2D vector and raster tool. With puppet rigging, 2D mesh deformation, and vector based auto tweening. This thing can produce broadcast quality 2D animation (and in fact was used to animate Futurama). The source of which was just released last year. It does not yet support wide color gamuts. It doesn't output OpenEXR. But give that dev team time. They've done great work over the last year. And there's an experimental Linux port up and running with MyPaint brushes added to the mix. \n\nNobody switched to Linux for LibreOffice. It's good. But not compelling enough given the commodity price of MSOffice. Nobody will switch to Linux for any _one_ of those tools I listed. But add them together as a functioning package tailored to support cluster rendering over the cloud on Linux instances, and you've got a killer app that justifies the switch to Linux. \n\nBut what that wouldn't do is justify a switch to either KDE or Gnome. If the either the KDE or Gnome dev teams realized this and worked to integrate all these tools together into a cohesive platform on their desktops, they'd win the Linux desktop. Hands down. And would see widespread deployment in the entertainment and creative design fields. \n", "subreddit": "linux", "parent_id": "t1_dgbj5lm", "permalink": "/r/linux/comments/65ioil/why_doesnt_gnome_contribute_directly_to_firefox/dgbqgdm/", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1492320488.0, "score": 0, "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "edited": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "dgatueh", "author": "ParanoidFactoid", "body": "> ...will be even more mainstream as the de-facto UNIX alternative to Windows on commodity hardware.\n\nLinux already is de-facto UNIX. Without it, UNIX would be dead. Except for perhaps the *BSDs. Which might have taken Linux's place, were it not for ambiguity over what would happen with the AT&T lawsuit back in the early 1990s. \n\nRegardless, UNIX is dead. \n\nLet's go back to 1995, to the humble beginnings of KDE. Back then, Linux (and the Intel BSDs) were toys. Stuff nerds played with in their free time at home because a Sparc 20, an SGI Indigo, or DEC Alpha or HP9000 workstation et all cost upward of $20K - $50K a pop. Those machines ran 'real' UNIX with 'real' OSF CDE. \n\nKDE and then Gnome projects were founded to copy CDE. Just look at KDE 1, it looks exactly like CDE. The free software guys couldn't afford CDE because OSF charged an arm and a leg for Motif and CDE licenses under Linux. Because no one developing for 'real UNIX' thought Linux was anything but a toy for sysadmins to play with at home. And in those days, they were right. \n\nBut the UNIX workstation vendors didn't think through Moore's law. They didn't realize Intel - with all those hundreds of millions of x86 chips sold (then!) - could possibly beat their more elegant RISC designs by economic brute force, with better lithography and chip fab. But Intel did. And drove them all out of business. \n\nWith them went commercial UNIX. Which left Linux the last one standing. Along the way were twists and turns (SCO!). But ultimately, CDE died a brutal death by the early to mid 2000s, and even Sun standardized on Gnome. Because they'd long given up on the desktop market, and were just trying to hold their own in the datacenter. \n\nKDE and Gnome share this history of trying to re-implement the failed strategy of OSF, building a common desktop for UNIX that would bring about application unity. Only everyone's forgotten this history. And the projects continue pursuing this strategy - like it's embedded in their unconscious - on inertia alone, seeking these goals even though they don't even remember why. \n\nYet if Wintel had changed the world by 2000, extinguishing the potential of Desktop UNIX by price power and mass deployments,  today the powerhouse of Wintel is falters because the desktop has been relegated to power users in lieu of tablets and smartphones. None of which run Windows. \n\nSo, what does it mean to take back the desktop? It means servicing those power users who need a computer to perform some task crucial to their workflow. From freelancers on up. Linux won't displace Windows across the board here, but it could break through in niche markets with the right strategy and tailored distributions. Like what Ubuntu has been trying with their creative distributions. (except they have no idea what creatives actually need - they're just throwing software in carte blanche, another problem Linux distributors have had since forever). \n\nIf the dev teams at KDE or Gnome realized this. That people will never install Linux to run KDE or Gnome, because the desktop was commoditized almost twenty years ago. But they could attract people to run Blender or OpenToonz or Krita or Inkscape or Audacity etc - essentially any tool that comes close to performance against its commercial counterparts and - most especially - available to render en masse across clusters for free (do you know what a yearly per seat subscription is for Maya!?!?!). If they realized this is a use case that could draw in ten of thousands or more seats of hardened professionals - a core community to attract a mass following in that field. And tailored their desktop to use cases like that. Basically, chasing ways to undercut major commercial offerings... You might see one or the other actually win this thing. This Desktop UNIX showdown in the not-so-OK corral that's been shooting duds for over thirty years. \n\nThis was Apple's marketshare. They've abandoned it to Windows. But it could be Linux's for the taking. Because you want to run the same stuff on your desktop that you plan to run on the farm so you know your render output will be consistent and deliverable on time. \n\nKDE and Gnome won't win by being 'better' (whatever that means). Hell, Windows isn't better. Yet for thirty years it's dominated. And the Mac is demonstrably better and has been since NeXTStep was released thirty years ago. But it's now a smartphone OS. Apple doesn't care about desktop power users. \n\nEvery Linux vendor out there should be salivating at this opportunity. Instead, Redhat remains mired in trying retain their data center deployments and service income streams, as the world shifts to cloud computing without RHEL service contracts. And Ubuntu, who thought they could best Gnome by copy KDE and Gnome's failed model of copying OSF's failure.\n\nIt's been a desktop clown show ever since Sun thought it a bright idea to dump NeWS for X11 because MIT.  \n\nRight now is a crucial time. Much of the FOSS creative software is competitively viable, which wasn't the case back then. The desktop is in decline, leaving Wintel in a business model lurch. And Apple has ceded the market. Linux vendors have a remarkable opportunity. A short window to take a bold step and change direction. \n\nNot with new software. With new strategy.

It's designed to fit the bill of presenting information (mostly one way, from publisher/author to user) and has still somewhat limited facility to help collect data from user.\n\nWhat XUL rightfully reused from HTML \"fame\" is CSS, which can work with any ~~XML~~ hierarchy-modeling language, because it is DOM-agnostic.\n\nSo yeah, XUL and HTML are not the same thing, why would they be when the two need to describe completely different kind of models?\n\nTo that effect, CSS is aptly suited for controlling appearance in either case.\n\nIf XUL presently duplicates HTML, this can be attributed to some feature overlap, partially due to lax commitee work perhaps. I agree they could have used the XHTML XML namespace, reusing things, as you refer to them. But you still need something else than HTML 5.

Of course, that depends on how strictly or loosely you want to hold the name to the various divergent forks of the WebKit codebase.\n\n> And your story about Apple dumping a tarball may have been applicable years ago but it isn't the case today.\n\nIt seems I misunderstood events when I was following them as they occurred.  [According to wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit#Split_development) (FWIW), the community problem between Apple and KDE wasn't that Apple dumped a single source tarball at the end.  Apple provided patchsets, but they were huge, poorly documented, contained incomplete features, and mostly required an NDA to get access.\n\nAs a whole, Apple's relationship with open source has had its ups and downs.

Use the old directory as a fall-back\n2. Continue using both directories (but prefer the new one)\n\nThe problems with each of these are as follows:\n\nHere I will use Bash as an example. Bash currently uses the following configuration file locations:\n\n* \\`/etc/profile\\`\n* \\`/etc/bash.bash\\_logout\\`\n* \\`\\~/.bashrc\\`\n* \\`\\~/.bash\\_profile\\`\n* \\`\\~/.bash\\_logout\\`\n* \\`\\~/.inputrc\\` (really it's for GNU readline, but we'll say it's for Bash anyway)\n* and the countless other files from the days before GNU (e.g. \\`.profile\\`).\n\nLet's now imagine that GNU decided to move \\`\\~/.bashrc\\`, \\`\\~/.bash\\_profile\\` & \\`\\~/.bash\\_logout\\` to \\`\\~/.config/bash/\\`. This would present several issues.\n\nDistributions such as Ubuntu aim to provide a good out of the box experience for the user, and one of the ways they do this is by providing pre-configured \\`\\~/.bashrc\\`, \\`\\~/.bash\\_profile\\` files. Now, it wouldn't be too difficult for Ubuntu to move them to their new locations, but it would certainly cause issues for the users. If the user loaded their personal \\`\\~/.bashrc\\` files onto their Ubuntu system, which should Bash use? The user's or Ubuntu's? And how would Bash know? Just try and think about the various possibilities here, and how difficult it would be to solve it.\n\nIf Bash were to use the fall-back method, the user's configuration files would not be loaded. This would greatly confuse many users, and it would take a great long amount of time before all users switch over to the new location. This is not to mention the \"tutorial problem\" where many of the existing tutorials out there which tell users to \"place this in \\`\\~/.bashrc\\`\", would stop working as that file is now the fall-back.\n\nThe alternative is to load both of the configuration files. This again has many issues. If Bash were to load both Ubuntu's custom \"user-friendly\" configuration and the user's config files, there may be problems with the order commands are loaded in. For example you may have created an alias which overrides another, depending on the order the files are loaded in, the reverse could happen. The \"tutorial problem\" will also occur for this situation.\n\nThat is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nThis is not to say of the many bug reports, stack overflow and reddit posts of users asking why \"insert an issue here\" has just happened.

If an application needs to create more than one dot file then they should be placed in a subdirectory with a name starting with a \u2019.\u2019 character, (a \"dot directory\"). In this case the configuration files should not start with the \u2019.\u2019 character.^11\n\n> ^11 It is recommended that apart from autosave and lock files programs should refrain from creating non dot files or directories in a home directory without user intervention.\n\nI'm failing to see the problem. While a lot of stuff currently uses folders like .config, .local, .cache, yes there are quite a few that still do not. Yes, mozilla's applications and SSH are offenders, but keep in mind, those applications are insanely old. Changing them now would cause a lot of unhappy users as a result, especially those who've been Linux users for many many years (including myself). Another thing to think about too is our shells have always used dot files that don't exist in a dot directory. I'm thinking back to even the Solaris days, you had .profile for example. I'm not really seeing any problems.\n\nI'm sure part of it is a lot of those who complain about the \"littering\" is because they run `ls -la`\nrather than keeping the `-a`option off of the command line, or in their file manager, they turn on hidden folders. \n\nWhen I'm in a home directory and I need to find my SSH stuff, my first instinct is `~/.ssh` - why would we want to change that? I'm on a brand new system, my first thought is to modify `~/.bashrc` - why would we want to change that? It's been like this for many years.\n\nThe only *valid* complaint, in my opinion, is when an application purposely creates a directory that does not start with a `.` (see the FHS). That's when I have a problem. But a directory like `.mozilla` or `.ssh` should not cause some sort of arbitrary alarm. \n\nThis more and more sounds like people just want to change things just to change them.\n\nI would refer to this [mail list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2014/11/msg01817.html) also.", "subreddit": "linux", "parent_id": "t3_971m0z", "permalink": "/r/linux/comments/971m0z/im_tired_of_folders_littering_my_home_directory/efn5c4z/", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1549173809.0, "score": 1, "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "edited": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "ljvtd9k", "author": "bigh-aus", "body": "Thank you for posting this - in addition it's important to actually *set the environment variables.*", "subreddit": "linux", "parent_id": "t3_971m0z", "permalink": "/r/linux/comments/971m0z/im_tired_of_folders_littering_my_home_directory/ljvtd9k/", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1724605766.0, "score": 1, "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "edited": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "lu91069", "author": "Agent_E11", "body": "Looks like Docker is reported, but has almost no traction [https://github.com/docker/cli/issues/2423](https://github.com/docker/cli/issues/2423)", "subreddit": "linux", "parent_id": "t3_971m0z", "permalink": "/r/linux/comments/971m0z/im_tired_of_folders_littering_my_home_directory/lu91069/", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1730153089.0, "score": 1, "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "edited": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "e44tr9t", "author": "justasug", "body": "You can change the location of the configuration files for some of the programs on the list.

After little trouble, I got it working, however!\n\nI hope my instructions are correct, but this is what I did. Feel free to correct them.\n\n**1)** Install rewritefs (AUR: [rewritefs-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rewritefs-git/))\n\n**2)** Move *all* your dotfiles and dotfolders from `$HOME` to `$HOME/.config/` folder (excluding `.config`, `.cache` & `.local` folders). Remove the dot prefix from the names of those moved dotfiles/folders. You should end up of having only three dotfolders in your $HOME dir: `.cache`, `.config` and `.local` (and no dotfiles at all). All your previous dotfiles/folders are now in `$HOME/.config`, without the dot prefix in their name. Right? Good. Go ahead.\n\n**3)** Add file `/etc/rewritefs.conf` with the following contents:\n\n    m#^(?!\\.)# .\n    m#^\\.(cache|config|local)# .\n    m#^\\.# .config/\n\n**4)** Uncomment `user_allow_other` in `/etc/fuse.conf`. According to the [rewritefs author](https://github.com/sloonz/rewritefs/issues/2), you must do it:\n\n>The files are owned by the user of the process that create them, which is rewritefs, not your applications. You have to run rewritefs as \\[user\\], not root.\n\nIn the following steps (5-7)...\n\n* ...`<username>` refers obviously to your true username on your system.\n* ...I assume that your `$HOME` folder and system are on the same partition.\n\n**5)** Add the following entry into `/etc/fstab`:\n\n    /mnt/home/<username> /home/<username> rewritefs config=/etc/rewritefs.conf,allow_other,uid=<username_UID>,gid=<username_GID> 0 0\n\nNOTE: It is important to set `username_UID` and `username_GID` bits in `/etc/fstab`. Otherwise you may end up creating new files which belong to group `root` instead of your actual primary group in `$HOME`.\n\n\u200b\n\nNOTE: If you have `$HOME` folder in another HDD/SSD, you should use that location instead of `/mnt/home/<username>` in the above `/etc/fstab` entry. Additionally, you can skip step 6.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor example, I have my `$HOME` in a separate HDD partition, which is mounted at `/mnt/hdd` (I have defined this in `/etc/fstab`). Therefore, my true `$HOME` folder locates at `/mnt/hdd/home/<username>` so I use that location instead in my above rewritefs `/etc/fstab` entry.\n\n**6)** Log out (!), switch to another TTY and login as another user (I'd recommend root) or alternatively unmount the partition where your `$HOME` locates at.

Unlike the Mac port that just quite literally worked out of the box, the Linux one had a few problems and just getting Linux itself to behave is a challenge of its own.

But for many ALSA drivers it still corrupts the sound if for example two sources with differing sampling rates are mixed, because the ALSA drivers in question don't report the position of the playhead properly which messes up PAs internal scheduling. Speaking of scheduling: Since PA lives in userspace it can't do anything about processes at the end of the scheduling queue which are due to submitting a buffer.

If there were a universal master clock, you'd for example know exactly that in a 24FPS/48kHz video/audio there are exactly 2000 audio samples per frame and with every v-sync all a video player had to do would be sending the next frame and the next 2000 audio samples to the video/audio peripherals.\n\nBut with the current state of affairs when the v-sync happens the audio output may be dozens of samples behind or ahead of the video, so the player has to query for the current position of the audio playhead, timestretch the next audio frame to adjust for that difference and submit with that. Oh and of course you can't use block waiting for v-sync because if the audio plays \"faster\" then you'd underrun the audio buffer.\n\nGames actually have it easier than video players: Your typical game audio engine keeps a round robin buffer of audio frames, which is constantly cycles through to the audio device. Events happening in the game (and on the screen) simply mix at into the next available audio buffer and because in-game sound is mixed ad-hoc from several very short blips (sound bites) you don't notice if each blip gets out of sync with the video after dozens of frames, as each blip is only a couple of frames long. And when it comes to NPC speech it's usually the audio position that controls the animation. As long as the sampling rates of all audio resources is identical mixing is a non issue: You simply add up everything, applying an attenuation factor and/or impulse response filters for audio effects; that's easy, well understood and hard to get wrong.\n\nBut what really get annoying fast is resampling. Resampling itself is a well understood problem in itself: evaluate a sinc/Lanczos kernel for the desired resampling factor and perform a convolution. The problem with that approach is, that this theoretical approach only works for signals defined over their whole duration. But it doesn't work if you chop up a waveform into frames as it happens in PC audio. Also perfect sinc resampling if implemented naively is slow. One can dramatically improve on that though, interested parties I suggest to read the publications that led to the development of libresample.\n\nIn my PhD research I have to deal with resampling a lot; actually an even more difficult kind of resampling, namely nonuniform resampling (the phase linearize a signal which phase is not linear in time); at the sampling rates I work with (several GHz) k-clocking the ADCs doesn't work very well.", "subreddit": "linux", "parent_id": "t1_d2sumpk", "permalink": "/r/linux/comments/4htwl7/just_ported_my_first_game_over_to_linux_and_it/d2swhu2/", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462393321.0, "score": 26, "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "edited": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "d2sq1eh", "author": "stefantalpalaru", "body": "Nice one.

This is over simplifying it into a strawman argument that has some truth to it but doesn't prove some blanketed statement that Linux programs shouldn't support different options for a single thing like audio.\n\nFirst of all, if you're not coding something to do with audio you shouldn't have to worry about different complex audio implementations. This is similar to his argument, but it doesn't mean handling one single option is the only answer.\n\nIt might mean there's not a single great library to abstract this for you. It means a project should exist that offers an API so you don't have to worry about what the user chooses. You shouldn't have to worry about low level audio if you're not writing a program that is related to that.\n\nThat should be the one moving part that is prone to failure. Audio implementations should be decoupled for a program that just needs to use audio.\n\nVideo games will often support directx and opengl. That doesn't mean they implemented the game's graphics engine. There are two moving parts, parts they shouldn't have to worry about if using a proper engine to abstract that. Just like we don't worry about whether a user uses XFS or ext3. We shouldn't have to implement any moving parts.\n\nWith proper design and decoupling logic, it doesn't matter so much how many moving parts you have. It matters how easy it is to diagnose what moving parts failed. There are millions of moving parts for every program you write. It doesn't mean that it's impossible to fix bugs when one breaks.\n\nIf the guy who made that statement believes he doesn't need to support more than one thing, I don't care. It doesn't mean that it's the only way to do it. It doesn't mean \"linux is about choice\" is suddenly wrong.\n\nPeople have a tendency to quote one absolute statement with some good arguments and believe that makes the absolute statement true in all cases, and it just gets parroted like it's a golden rule, just like \"Linux is about choice\" and \"do one thing and do it well\". These are just educated opinions, and make a lot of sense sometimes. It means there are arguments to both sides. It doesn't mean that you did it wrong if you chose to do otherwise. It just means you should have a good reason for doing so.\n\nIn the end, support your users in a practical way. If your users don't need it to work with a certain technology, dont spend extra time adding those moving parts.

If you just want consumer-level audio, and don't care about the bloat, any distro that integrates PulseAudio should do well - assuming your hardware is supported.  If you want pro-level audio, things like KXStudio and UbuntuStudio, which provide the full range of options for audio, are a great path to take -assuming you can take responsibility for the configuration for your specific hardware setup, yourself.

Maybe not as immediate priority but yes.\n\nHistorically this isn't the case. MS, Adobe, Oracle, IBM don't fix things for their individual customers, only for their big corporate clients. I have been in IT with enough levels of \"Ms partner support\" that we still didn't get stuff fixed. The only reason IBM send engineers to our location is because when you spend $2 million on DB cluster, it kinda ensures support. \n\nThey just don't make enough from individual consumers to truly care. \n\n\n>Money does get nice support :)\n\n\nTypically it's the only choice with a closed product unless there is a community forums. Then were back to the same level of support as just about all FOSS products. \n\n\n>Point is if I am game developer no amount of driver code will help me because I do not understand the thing. All I can do then is look for someone with expertise and pay him/her to fix the problem if it is even doable. Sounds way worse than say windows where drivers pretty much work OK. \n\n\nIf your so myopic in your development that you can't trace the issue back to its source, even if you can't develop a fix for it, you shouldn't be making video games. Video game programming is literally the most cross discipline type of programming out there and requires you be flexible and adapt. \n\nOP isn't even a \"game dev\" yet they wrote a game. So why should they have to be a graphics dev to pole around with the graphics stack exactly?\n\n\n\n>With my gtx 550ti nouveau was is freezing entire machine soon after login. Want to guess if I fixed the problem? ;) Ofc I did, by using proprietary driver and later replacing card with some cheap passivelly cooled radeon.

Fortunately nivida has been releaseing specifications to make driver development require less reverse engineering to make forward progress. \n\nThat being said, proprietary drivers are also hit and miss. While nvidia has always had decent Linux drivers, ATI as mostly always sucked. \n\n \n\n>Not that many drivers are developed out of tree. Opens our centre video drivers still suck. NVidia proprietary driver is somewhat OK though. See.. Opens our centras does not magically make things good.\n\nSure but it's getting to the point where the open source Intel drivers are p great, and the ATI driver has gotta better than the closed source driver in some ways. \n\nNot saying it magically gets better as you claim. I'm saying with open access, people can help make it better without having to first work for say AMD/ATI or Nvidia. \n\nBy lowering the bar of access you raise the probably that a bug that doesn't affect the companies financially but does affect the community will get get fixed. \n", "subreddit": "linux", "parent_id": "t1_d2tglsf", "permalink": "/r/linux/comments/4htwl7/just_ported_my_first_game_over_to_linux_and_it/d2tm1d2/", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462442109.0, "score": 1, "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "edited": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "d2synr6", "author": "Unknown", "body": "It's simpler than that, not even the Steam client launches with an upstream system in Arch when you don't disable the runtime/rip out libc++ and others", "subreddit": "linux", "parent_id": "t1_d2sfnqf", "permalink": "/r/linux/comments/4htwl7/just_ported_my_first_game_over_to_linux_and_it/d2synr6/", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462396062.0, "score": 1, "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "edited": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "d2to7cw", "author": "stefantalpalaru", "body": "By proving I'm not a \"leecher\".", "subreddit": "linux", "parent_id": "t1_d2tmzes", "permalink": "/r/linux/comments/4htwl7/just_ported_my_first_game_over_to_linux_and_it/d2to7cw/", "author_flair_text": ":gentoo:", "created_utc": 1462448945.0, "score": 0, "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "edited": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "d2sqeis", "author": "FeepingCreature", "body": "ALSA doesn't work reliably for you, Pulse does.\n\nPulse doesn't work reliably for me, ALSA does.\n\nThis is the state of the world.\n\n(The difference is, ALSA apps run on Pulse.

You may encounter a few bumps here and there on the road, but the landscape is stunning and once you learn your way around your system you'll find that nowhere else you could find this level of comfort. :)\n\nA few quick broad advice to wish you the best on your way.\n\n**1/ Don't hesitate to ask for advice or search for something with keywords.**\n\nYou may be unlucky and have trouble with some devices or software, chances are some people will have worked on it already. Error messages on Linux are usually clearer and more informative than Windows, so it's easier for people to give you some tips or possibly straight solution.\n\n**2/ Don't force yourself on command line, but don't be afraid of it either!**\n\nGradual learning is the best approach, start with the classic \"install a new software\" (and it's so much faster than interface) and whatever is useful for you right now.\n\nI'd suggest focusing on \"find information\" commands which are much, much more powerful than interface once you know a few options: 'find' and 'du'. If you work with lots of basic text files, 'grep' will be very useful too.\n\nIt may seem a bit daunting at first, but it's really just like learning a language. And once you get the hang of it, some tasks will be achievable in seconds or minutes instead of minutes/hours. No exaggeration here.\n\n**3/ Whenever you plan on buying hardware, LOOK AHEAD AND PLAN!**\n\nThis is honestly the only problem still strong with Linux: driver compatibility with hardware, especially printers (Brother is reliable, HP has neat drivers too), network cards (avoid Killer chipsets) and gaming peripherals (improving gradually, but you'd better search before buying whatever brand you're looking at).\n\n**4/ Don't be afraid to experiment (reasonably \\^\\^)**\n\nAs long as you don't elevate yourself as administrator in command line ('sudo') and make some potentially data destructive move (like using the rm command which deletes files), it should be hard for you to really \"break\" something.\n\nYour interface should be fairly customizable (even if it's not KDE), feel free to look for colors and icons that you like. Sofwares are installed and desinstalled with just a few clicks or one command, always neatly, so it's no problem to install \"just for trying\" and uninstall at a whim.\n\n**5/ Save your /home regularly**\n\nLosing / crashing a system is bad, but easy to recover from. Losing your home is obviously bigger issue. :) You can use free software like for example FreeFileSync (or whatever else really) to make a full copy in a regular way, from your internal drive to an external one.\n\nThere are also several cloud storage providers that now offer Linux clients for easyness of use (from top of my head, Mega, PCloud, you can find updated list easy on internet).\n\nIf you can, saving system would be nice too but it requires to know a bit more about internals of Linux. Home is really the essential one for classic usage and normally stores everything you could care about: not only your documents, but also all personal data related to your software (browser bookmarks, mails, application settings, your desktop customization, etc).\n\n**Enjoy!**", "subreddit": "linux", "parent_id": "t3_kzzbcs", "permalink": "/r/linux/comments/kzzbcs/first_time_trying_linux_im_using_a_lightweight/gjqtyhs/", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1610995408.0, "score": 50, "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "edited": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "gjqtrzn", "author": "Unknown", "body": "I'm a new user as well.
